# SEC Common Stock Shares Outstanding Dashboard This is a single-page responsive web application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It fetches and displays the maximum and minimum common stock shares outstanding for a given company (identified by its CIK - Central Index Key) from the SEC's XBRL data API. ## Features - **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Retrieves common stock shares outstanding data directly from the SEC API. - **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly user interface. - **Interactive**: Displays key financial metrics (max and min shares outstanding) for fiscal years greater than 2020. - **CIK Parameter Support**: Allows users to specify a CIK in the URL (`?CIK=...`) to dynamically fetch data for different companies without page reload. - **Proxy Integration**: Demonstrates the concept of using a proxy (e.g., `allorigins.win`) for cross-origin requests, as required for dynamic CIK fetches from the SEC API. ## Setup and Usage To run this application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. All necessary code (HTML, CSS via CDN, and JavaScript) is contained within this single file. ### Default View (AutoZone) Upon opening `index.html`, the application defaults to fetching data for **AutoZone (CIK: 0000866787)**. ### Dynamic CIK Lookup You can view data for any other publicly traded company by appending a `CIK` query parameter to the URL. For example: - To view data for **Apple Inc. (CIK: 0000320193)**: `index.html?CIK=0000320193` - To view data for **Microsoft Corporation (CIK: 0000789019)**: `index.html?CIK=0000789019` The page will update dynamically without a full reload. ## Data Source The application fetches data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) XBRL API endpoint: `https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK[CIK]/dei/EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding.json` A descriptive `User-Agent` header is used for SEC API compliance during the initial AutoZone fetch. For dynamic CIK lookups, a public CORS proxy (`https://api.allorigins.win/get?url=...`) is employed to bypass potential cross-origin restrictions. ## Included Attachments - `uid.txt`: This file is included as provided.
